As society moves to a more virtual world, individuals today have greater responsibilities-- mainly, time management! Consider working at home alone. There’s no one to notice if you’re doing your work, no one to pester you to complete your part unless the deadline is close, and no one to make sure you’re continuously focused. In such an environment, planning is very important, so a to-do list will be quite beneficial. However, a simple to-do list with adding, modifying, and removing events is simply not enough. If you were to be able to keep up with such a to-do list, there’s a big chance that you are already managing your time well.

To aid people to be more responsible, we decided to make a to-do list-- but not just any to-do list. Our idea is to make a desktop application that periodically screams at the user to write their to-do list, throws reminders to do their work accordingly and mark each work as completed, and automatically transfers unfinished work to the next day’s to-do list. 

We thought that the main reason behind people not using a to-do list is actually forgetting that they need to keep writing their to-do list. And also that it is tedious. Thus, we aim to remind the users every single day that they must keep up with their to-do list, and we also make sure automatically transferable parts to be automatically done! No one likes to spend time copy-pasting things they have already written somewhere else.

We hope to be able to help many to be more responsible with their own time, and our to-do list will serve that exact purpose.
